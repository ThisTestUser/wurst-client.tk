It's been a while, hasn't it?

So I've recorded a video with WiZARD again. This time we talk about some the new features that were added in the last couple of Wurst updates.

The first thing that we are covering in this video is the Navigator GUI that allows you to manage features faster than ever before. And not only that, but it also lets you change the settings, add keybinds and more, all in a faster and more user-friendly way than anything you've seen before.

Then we talk about (taco 'bout) the new TP-Aura that quickly teleports you all around the entity that you are attacking. Doing that makes it nearly impossible for other players to hit you back - you're just too quick for them.
