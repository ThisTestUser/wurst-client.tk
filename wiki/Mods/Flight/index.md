## Overview
The Flight mod allows you to fly. It has a configurable speed and includes bypasses for vanilla Minecraft's "Flying is not enabled on this server" kick, the Mineplex AntiCheat system and certain versions of NoCheat+.

## Text Tutorial
The basic usage of Flight couldn't be more simple: Turn it on and you fly, turn it off and you don't fly. You can also configure the speed at which you fly by using the Flight Speed slider on the Navigator page of the Flight mod.

The slightly more advanced part are the bypasses. You can bypass Mineplex AntiCheat (MAC) and some versions of NoCheat+ with Flight, but you have to do it correctly.

So in order for Flight to bypass MAC, you first have to activate another mod called AntiMAC. MAC is the AntiCheat plugin on Mineplex that is supposed to prevent people from flying there.

Note that there is one game on Mineplex called "The Bridges" that doesn't use the Mineplex AntiCheat system, but instead uses NoCheat+. Therefore the MAC bypass for Flight won't allow you to fly in that game.

The way to bypass NoCheat+ is similar, but you have to enable YesCheat+ instead of AntiMAC. Keep in mind that this bypass will only work on some versions of NoCheat+, but not on all of them.

There isn't really a way to find out whether or not a specific server has the right version of NoCheat+ for this bypass or not. Just try it out and see if it works.

Also note that the YesCheat+ version of Flight does not allow you to fly any higher than where you started. You can fly down and back up, but not up and back down.

Lastly, Flight has a "Flight-Kick-Bypass" checkbox that, when checked, protects you from getting kicked for flying. This is a new feature in Wurst 2.19, any previous versions don't have this checkbox.

Normally, any Minecraft server (even vanilla ones) will kick you for "Flying is not enabled on this server" if you fly for at least 4 seconds without touching the ground, but this bypass will prevent that from happening.

The fly-kick bypass is incompatible with the NoCheat+ and MAC bypasses, so it will only work if both YesCheat+ and AntiMAC are disabled. Furthermore, it can only protect you while you are flying at most 300m above ground.
