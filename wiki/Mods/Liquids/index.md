## Text Tutorial
Liquids can be used to place blocks directly adjacent to water or lava blocks, allowing you to build bridges or swimming houses. Doing that is as simple as activating Liquids and placing the blocks.

When used in creative mode, it also allows you break water and lava blocks. Since water can refill itself very quickly (usually more quickly than you can break it), it is recommended to use Liquids in combination with FastBreak or Nuker for that task.

Note that Liquids cannot bypass NoCheat+, as NoCheat+ can detect and prevent block placements on air or liquids.
