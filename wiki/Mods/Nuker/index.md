## Text Tutorial
Nuker has 4 different modes: Normal, ID, Flat and Smash. The default mode is Normal, which will break all blocks around you as long as they are within the set range.

ID mode will only break blocks that have a certain ID. The ID can be set by either left-cliking a block that has the desired ID or by using the [.nuker command](/wiki/Commands/nuker) (e.g. `.nuker id 1` or `.nuker name stone`).

Flat mode will only break blocks that are above your feet. This protects you from accidentally digging yourself into a hole and allows you to flatten the terrain around you.

Smash mode will only break blocks that can be destroyed with one click, such as flowers and torches. The blocks that this mode will destroy can also depend on the tool that you are using.

For instance, leaves can only be broken with one click if using shears and Smash mode will only try to destroy them if you are holding shears.
