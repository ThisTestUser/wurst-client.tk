Changes the settings of Search or toggles it.

## Syntax
- `.search` toggles Search.

- `.search id <block_id>` sets the ID for Search.

- `.search name <block_name>` sets the ID for Search using a block name. The `minecraft:` prefix can be omitted, therefore `furnace` is the same block as `minecraft:furnace`.
