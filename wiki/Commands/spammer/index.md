title: How to Use .spammer (Spammer Settings - Run WSPAM Files)
layout: wiki
category: Command
---
Changes the delay of Spammer (the time Spammer waits between sending messages) or loads a WSPAM script.

## Syntax
- `.spammer delay <delay>` sets the delay to the given amount of milliseconds.

- `.spammer spam <file>` spams the given file. This works without the `.wspam` file extension.
