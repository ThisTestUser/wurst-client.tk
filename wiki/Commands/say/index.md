## Text Tutorial
Especially when using Wurst to cheat in PVP games, you might get into a situation where an admin will ask you to proof that you are not cheating by typing something like `.legit`, `.help` or `...` into the chat.

If you were to type `.legit` directly into the chat while using Wurst, you would just get an error saying that `.legit` is not a valid Wurst command. The `.legit` message would not make it into the chat and would not be seen by the admin that asked you to send it.

But if you instead type `.say .legit`, everything after `.say ` will make it into the chat and will be seen by others. So you can simply type `.say .legit` to send `.legit`, `.say .help` to send `.help`, `.say ...` to send `...`, and so on.
